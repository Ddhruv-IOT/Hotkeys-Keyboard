## Working

The Hotkeys Keyboard operates through a seamless combination of **hardware and software** components. The hardware setup includes an Arduino board and three push buttons connected to it. When a button is pressed, it sends a corresponding signal to the Arduino. The Arduino acts as a bridge between the buttons and the computer. On the software side, a Python script runs on the computer, waiting for input from the Arduino via serial communication. Once the Arduino receives a button press signal, it sends the corresponding signal to the Python script. The Python script interprets the signal and performs the associated action.

For example, when Button 1 is pressed, the Arduino sends a signal of "1" to the Python script. The Python script recognizes this signal as a request to execute the F5 key, which is commonly used to run Python code in Spyder. It emulates the F5 key press event, effectively running the code.

Similarly, when Button 2 is pressed, the Arduino sends a signal of "2" to the Python script. The Python script interprets this signal as a command to trigger the "Win+M" key combination, minimizing all open windows on the computer screen.

Lastly, when Button 3 is pressed, the Arduino sends a signal of "3" to the Python script. The Python script recognizes this signal as a request to lock the workstation, ensuring privacy and security.

***Through this seamless integration of hardware and software, the Hotkeys Keyboard provides users with a convenient and efficient way to execute essential functions with just a press of a button.***
